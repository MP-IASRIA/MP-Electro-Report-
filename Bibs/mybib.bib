abstract = {Accurate vessel segmentation in ultrasound images is difficult to realize given the poor image quality of such images. In this study, a local-phase-based snake is proposed to improve the accuracy of vessel segmentation in ultrasound images. In the proposed snake framework, image energy is generated using the local phase of the ultrasound image. By using the intensity-invariant local phase, we can obtain identical image energies on all edges regardless of the strengths of their intensity contrasts. In addition, by minimizing the identical local-phase-based image energy, the snake can be pulled uniformly toward the strong and weak edges, and accurate vessel segmentation in ultrasound images can be achieved. The performance of the proposed segmentation method is evaluated using three types of vessels. We then compare it with the performances of the gradient-based standard snake and snake that uses the balloon model. The evaluation results show that the proposed local-phase-based snake accurately segments vessels from ultrasound images and performs better than the known methods.}

abstract = {This article presents a new deep learning approach for cardiac arrhythmia (17 classes) detection based on long-duration electrocardiography (ECG) signal analysis. Cardiovascular disease prevention is one of the most important tasks of any health care system as about 50 million people are at risk of heart disease in the world. Although automatic analysis of ECG signal is very popular, current methods are not satisfactory. The goal of our research was to design a new method based on deep learning to efficiently and quickly classify cardiac arrhythmias. Described research are based on 1000 ECG signal fragments from the MIT - BIH Arrhythmia database for one lead (MLII) from 45 persons. Approach based on the analysis of 10-s ECG signal fragments (not a single QRS complex) is applied (on average, 13 times less classifications/analysis). A complete end-to-end structure was designed instead of the hand-crafted feature extraction and selection used in traditional methods. Our main contribution is to design a new 1D-Convolutional Neural Network model (1D-CNN). The proposed method is 1) efficient, 2) fast (real-time classification) 3) non-complex and 4) simple to use (combined feature extraction and selection, and classification in one stage). Deep 1D-CNN achieved a recognition overall accuracy of 17 cardiac arrhythmia disorders (classes) at a level of 91.33% and classification time per single sample of 0.015 s. Compared to the current research, our results are one of the best results to date, and our solution can be implemented in mobile devices and cloud computing.}

abstract = {The market for wearable healthcare devices is one of the fastest growing markets of this decade. In this paper, we conduct a thorough review of the peer-reviewed and grey literatures on wearable healthcare. Then, using SWOT analysis, we examine the market’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and some of the major threats it faces. Our structured examination revealed that the primary areas of innovation in wearable healthcare include infant safety and care, elderly care, chronic disease management, military support, sports medicine, and preventive medicine. We also found that several hurdles stand in the way of the wearable market’s success; these include threats to data security and privacy, regulatory requirements, cost of system operation and management, and subpar adoption rates. Overall, our analysis revealed that significant effort is needed to address the identified technological, societal, and governmental barriers that are preventing the wearable healthcare market from reaching its full potential. Incentives by the Federal government that fuel innovation and encourage adoption by healthcare professionals and patients is deemed necessary for the wearable market’s continued growth.}
